## Description

**Pantri.com** is a website that allow user to search recipes using their inputted ingredients.

## Our Vision

Dinner Made Easy

## Motivation

We all have a lot of ingredients in our pantry, but we donâ€™t know what to make with it.

## Risks

* First major software project
* Some members new to HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Copyright risk
* Overflow of datas
* Security
* Server hosting

## Mitigation Strategy

* Working hard through problems, meet deadlines
* Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript from members more experienced in these languages
* Link users to websites, instead of taking recipes as our own
* Overflow  of datas solved by testing and designing a good algorithm
* Not asking for any personal information - just username and password
* Planned to host on colorado.edu servers, should have some security through those
* Hosting problems will be consult with the school server lender

## Requirements

* Matching user input to google search
* Account that stores ingredients with the option to remove items once used or gone bad
* List of needed ingredients, or search for only those ingredients
* User saved recipes
* Links to a couple trusted recipe websites with the title as the link
